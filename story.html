<p>The long-awaited moment has finally arrived. You have just left your {{insert.occasion}}. For all of the occasion/’s significance, you found yourself unable to concentrate during the event, to be fully present. Thoughts and revelries about this evening/’s meeting with {{insert.character}} whirled through your mind like a {{insert.insect}} on {{insert.energy}}. {{insert.character}} told you to meet them at the fountain in the square at midnight. You could tell by their tone that have something important to tell you. It is 12:53am. You sit, bored out of your mind, on the fountain/’s edge, lazily dragging your {{insert.body}} through the water, fighting the growing certainty budding in your breast that {{insert.character}} stood will not come.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, your love {{insert.character}} appears over the horizon. Even from this unfathomable distance, you can see that they are crying. Tears run down {{insert.character}}’s cheeks like [gooey, sticky liquid], the full moon refracting off each fallen drop like [shiny object] in a [lightsource]’s glare. They run to you, their footfalls reverberating throughout the square like the hooves of a herd of [herd animal] on a [type of building] floor. As they approach, you reach out your hands to meet [inert name]’s; they are damp and warm against your own, like some misbegotten lovechild of a [something wet] and a [something warm]. Eagerly -- desperately -- you pull your beloved into an intimate embrace, deeply breathing in their fragrance of [something fragrant] and [something foul-smelling]. You distractedly note that you find their smell slightly offputting, but the throes of love almost immediately banish this thought from your mind. Passion grips your heart with all the might of s [powerful animal] crushing [something squishy]. There, in the fountain’s misty shadow, you realize what you must do. Barely aware of your own actions, you slowly pull away from [insert name] and gaze into their eyes will all the heartfelt tenderness of [sexy actor/actress] in that one scene in [favorite movie]. Unconsciously, you drop to one knee. [insert name] gasps in shock and delight and also...sorrow?</p>

“I cannot accept your proposal,” [insert name] whispers with averted eyes.
Pained, but seeking to comfort, you intone with adoration, “But why?”
[insert name] musters what you can tell is the all the strength and courage in their body. “Because,” they begin, “I am a monster. A vampire, specifically. That is what I wanted to tell you tonight. So you’ll understand why I have to leave you.”
You stand, drawing yourself up to your full height. You grab [insert name] firmly by the shoulder and draw them into another intimate embrace. Pulling back the hair from their ear, you whisper, “I love you, and I love vampires. Turn me, so that we might spend eternity together.”
[insert name] sobs into your shoulder. “Nothing would make me happier than to spend the coming eons with you. Together we can witness the universe’s descent into entropy.”
This was the most important moment of both of your lives. You had found true love. You would soon gain immortality. All in the fountain’s misty shadow.
